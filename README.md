# Programming Notebook

This repository documents my learning journey across multiple programming languages, tools, and topics — starting with **Python socket programming** and expanding into everything else I explore.

## 📄 What’s Inside
- Markdown-based guides, notes, and code snippets
- Dialogue-style learning logs (e.g., Pro vs. Newbie conversations)
- Exported PDFs for convenient offline reading
- Projects and experiment files organized by topic

## 🧠 Why This Repo
I’m using this space as my personal programming notebook. Whenever I explore a new topic — be it a framework, algorithm, or tool — I document it here in a format that’s easy to revisit and learn from. Some sections will be conversational, others will be technical deep dives.

## 📂 Example Topics Covered
- Python (sockets, scripting, tools)
- JavaScript & Node.js
- Web development (HTML, CSS, frameworks)
- Backend systems & APIs
- Git & GitHub workflows
- C, C++, Java, Bash and more coming!
